        OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE has the potential to be very secure. Unlike
        proprietary code that can only be accessed directly by its own
        developers, anyone can vet open source projects to spot flaws and bugs.
        In practice, though, being open source is no panacea. Now, code
        repository GitHub is rolling out new tools for its GitHub Advanced
        Security suite that will make it easier to root out vulnerabilities in
        the open source projects managed on its platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open source code present a few security challenges. In practice there
        aren't always enough people with the right expertise looking at it. And
        open source projects are generally ad hoc; they don't necessarily have a
        clear process in place for people to submit vulnerabilities, or the
        resources available for someone to patch them. Even if you surmount
        those hurdles, you may not know who's actually using your open source
        code and needs a patch.
      </p>

      <p>
        "A lot of what we talk about is there’s a vulnerability, what’s the
        workflow for that vulnerability, now it gets addressed," says Jamie
        Cool, vice president of product for security for Microsoft-owned GitHub.
        "But the nirvana is you don’t introduce the vulnerability to begin with.
        You stop it from ever showing up. It really seems like this is a problem
        we should be able to help developers not introduce again and again, but
        by and large we haven’t succeeded at that as a software industry yet."
      </p>
      <p>
        In September, GitHub acquired the code scanning tool Semmle as part of a
        plan to help the GitHub community catch common security flaws
        automatically. Advanced Security includes this service, calling out
        which line of code contains a potential vulnerability, why it might be
        exploitable, and how to fix it. In addition to this automatic scanning,
        Semmle's technology can also be used manually by security researchers.
        GitHub's goal is to use Advanced Security as both a warning system for
        developers and a built-in framework for bug hunters to find and report
        additional issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        GitHub Advanced Security also includes tools that scan user
        "repositories," essentially the folder where they store their
        development projects, for secret data like passwords and private keys
        that shouldn't be exposed and accessible. GitHub works with a number of
        partners, including Amazon Web Services and Alibaba, to understand the
        characteristics of their authentication tokens and spot them
        automatically. The feature has already been available to public
        repositories for a couple of years, but today GitHub is also adding
        support to scan private repositories as well. GitHub says that eight
        percent of active public repositories had a secret exposed in them
        during the last month alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        With these new tools, GitHub is working to address security issues at a
        vast scale. Though not all open source projects rely on GitHub, the
        majority do, and the platform is as much a social network for the
        community as a development tool. By offering features like Advanced
        Security, GitHub can create an environment where more projects in the
        diverse landscape of open source have access to the same types of tools
        large companies build to improve and safeguard their proprietary code.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The truth is for most maintainers they become maintainers by accident,"
        says GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. "They make something, it becomes widely
        used and then suddenly they’re in this position of responsibility with
        regards to computer security—maybe for banks, for governments. They may
        not have a background in security and yet we have to make sure that the
        code they publish is secure. So the challenge is to make it automatic
        and make it natural."
      </p>
      <p>
        Though catching more security flaws across GitHub projects is crucial,
        the interconnected nature of software today still poses security
        challenges. Rather than writing every function and component from
        scratch, virtually every software product contains a mix of proprietary
        code and open source components. Your fitness tracker and smartphone,
        not to mention your car, all contain open source elements from numerous
        developer projects in addition to the hardware and software created by
        the name brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reporting vulnerabilities and getting the right patches to the right
        places are still prominent problems, because of these interdependencies.
        In November, GitHub launched an initiative called Security Lab to help
        the community keep track of bugs more easily and automate more of the
        patching process.
      </p>
      <p>
        While GitHub is in a position to make a major impact on how the open
        source community handles security, Chris Wysopal, chief technology
        officer of the software auditing firm Veracode, points out that the
        progress GitHub is making doesn't let the rest of the industry off the
        hook.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The thing about GitHub is it’s inherently open, so something to improve
        the landscape of open source doesn’t have to be done by GitHub,” Wysopal
        says. “There’s nothing stopping a third-party from scanning all of the
        GitHub repos, looking for vulnerabilities, and sending information to
        those project maintainers.” That would take a lot of resources. GitHub
        itself says it costs millions of dollars to provide the free
        vulnerability scanning and analysis tools in Advanced Security. The
        company hopes, though, that its own investment can serve as a model for
        why it pays to prioritize security in open source.
